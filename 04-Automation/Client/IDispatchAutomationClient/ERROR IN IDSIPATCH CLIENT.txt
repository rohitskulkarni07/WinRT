Error:a value of type "const wchar_t *" cannot be used to initialize an entity of type "OLECHAR *""

Solution:You need to make your string literal type const because in C++ or in C it is a 	constant array of char, unlike in early(98 std) C where it is just an array of char.
	You cannot change a string literal, so making it const is preferred in C++ for extra 	safety. 

	
ERROR and INFO:argument of type "const OLECHAR **" is incompatible with parameter of type "LPOLESTR *"

GetIDsOfName funtion needs Address of function (name of a function itself address of a first instruction) it must be type of LPOLESTR and we are passing it OLECHAR
THat must need to be typecasted to LPOLESTR*

Solution::(LPOLESTR*)&szFunctionName1 this will solve the error
